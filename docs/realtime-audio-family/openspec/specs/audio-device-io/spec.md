## Bencina Realtime Callback Doctrine

Status: mandatory family standard
Revision: 2026-05-23-family-standard
Source: Ross Bencina, "Real-time audio programming 101: time waits for nothing"
Use in this package: project paraphrase, elevated to engineering law

This doctrine applies to every audio callback, render block, host `processBlock`, device callback, scheduler drain, panic path, meter extraction path, and every function reachable from those paths.

**Rule zero:** if the bounded worst-case execution time is not known, the operation is not allowed in the realtime callback.

Forbidden inside the callback or callback-reachable code:

1. No heap allocation, deallocation, resizing, or hidden allocator use.
2. No mutex, blocking lock, semaphore wait, condition variable wait, thread join, sleep, spin-until-ready loop, or scheduler-dependent wait.
3. No file, disk, network, console, logging, printf-style output, GUI, runtime dispatch, JSON parsing, OSC parsing, MIDI-file parsing, preset loading, sample loading, route discovery, or device enumeration.
4. No OS or framework call unless the exact call path has been audited as bounded, nonblocking, allocation-free, and callback-safe.
5. No algorithm with unbounded or poor worst-case timing. Average-case speed is not a defense.
6. No call into code that may break any rule above.
7. No call into code that the project cannot audit or does not trust to follow these rules.

Required inside or feeding the callback:

1. Use bounded worst-case algorithms, preferably O(1) for callback work.
2. Amortize bursty computation outside realtime or across many samples so no single callback takes a surprise hit.
3. Preallocate and precompute in the preparation plane.
4. Use fixed-capacity, wait-free, callback-facing queues or latest-value snapshots with explicit overflow policy.
5. Prefer audio-callback-only state. When crossing planes, use immutable prepared snapshots, atomics, or bounded SPSC exchange patterns.
6. Treat "lock-free" as insufficient unless the callback operation is also bounded and wait-free for the actual use.
7. Prove compliance with code review, instrumentation, and performance gates before merging any callback-adjacent change.

No exception is allowed unless a project ADR names the exact operation, proves bounded worst-case behavior, adds a regression gate, and is accepted before implementation.



## Purpose

Audio device I/O adapts host or device callbacks to the realtime core.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Thin callback adapter

The adapter SHALL convert buffers and events into project-owned views and call the realtime core without allocation, locks, waits, logging, I/O, UI, parsing, route discovery, or device discovery.

### Requirement: Device lifecycle outside realtime

Device enumeration, format negotiation, route validation, and lifecycle error recovery SHALL occur outside the callback.

### Requirement: Route mismatch before arming

If the configured output route does not match the required project route, playback or capture SHALL fail before arming rather than being repaired in the callback.
